The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Other,23550,这看起来就像70年代的人想象中2025年汽车的样子。,It looks like how people in the 70's imagined 2025 cars would look like
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,9543,当你说它不是真的时候，我好害怕那辆车会消失……还以为是AI之类的东西。,i was so scared that the car was gonna disapear when you said it was not real... thought it would be ai or something
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,2608,在我看来，“英里/后备箱”是一个有效的计量单位。,"""Miles per trunk"" is a valid unit of measurement as far as I'm concerned."
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,415,我不仅会买一辆，而且我已经要买了！当然，要等他们开始生产（我是一名Aptera的加速计划支持者）。这绝对是我见过的最酷的交通概念。如果你每天的行驶里程不超过40英里，那它对地球几乎没有影响。太酷了。,"Not only would I buy one, I am buying one! That is, once they start production (I'm an Aptera Accelerator).  This is the coolest transportation idea I've ever seen - by far. Almost no impact to the planet if you don't drive more than 40 miles a day. Too cool."
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,8862,竟然让一个被绑架的人来展示空间 😂😂,Not the kidnapped guy to show the space 😂😂
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,875,1:00 当你被绑架，但绑匪的论点却非常有道理时。,1:00 When you're being kidnapped but your kidnapper is making some pretty valid points.
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,1920,我真的很喜歡這個設計。特別是它甚至不被歸類為汽車，這點讓我的大腦更容易接受它的奇特之處。,I genuinely like the design. Especially the fact that it doesn't even classify as a car. It makes my brain accept the eccentricity more.
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,31,我预订了！我已经为我的 Aptera 做好准备了！我还买了一个小比例的模型！我很期待亲眼看到帐篷和宠物附加组件。我也很喜欢“维修权”这一点。,I have a reservation! I'm ready for my Aptera! I bought a small scale figure! I'm excited to see the tent and pet add-ons in petson. Love the right to repair aspect too.
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Other,845,问题不在于（人们的）兴趣。他们已经有大概4万多份预购订单了。问题完全在于资金。我为他们祈祷。我是一名早期的预购者，也是一名加速计划的支持者。,"The problem isn’t interest. They have like 40,000+ pre-orders.

The problem is entirely money. Crossing my fingers. I’m an early pre-order, and accelerator."
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,328,作为一个澳大利亚人，我很想用这个当日常代步车。,"As an Australian, I would love this for a daily driver."
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Suggestion,1906,建议每次评测时都让迈尔斯待在后备箱里。如果在每个视频里，一打开后备箱就能看到迈尔斯在里面悠闲地待着，那会非常搞笑。,Petition to have Miles in every car's trunk during the review. Would be hilarious if in every video when the trunk opens its just Miles chilling
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Suggestion,19,生产这个产品的公司刚在2025年10月16日成为一家上市公司（我写这条评论时是4天前），现在每股只要5美元。我强烈建议大家买入一些，因为随着这家公司的知名度越来越高并开始生产，股价很可能会不断上涨，购买股票也能帮助他们实现量产。,The company that makes this just came a public traded company on October 16 2025 (4 days ago as of me writing this comment) and it’s only $5 per share rn I would definitely highly suggest buying some up as it’s likely too grow more and more when this company gets more and more known and starts production buying shares will also help them reach production
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,85,三年前就预订了一个，我非常喜欢它的愿景和技术。希望他们能成功冲过终点线。,"Reserved one three years ago, I just loved the vision and the tech. Hoping they cross the finish line."
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,688,我的意思是，设计怎么样都无所谓，我宁愿在街上看到这些，也不想看到那种被称作卡车、盲区多得像个水泥砖子弹的东西。,"I mean, design is whatever, I'd rather see these on the street than a blind spot prone cinderblock bullet known as a truck"
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,24,我已经在购买名单上了，所以是的，我会买这辆车。,"I am on the buyers list so yes, I would buy this vehicle."
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,458,我很高兴终于看到有人将空气动力学用于提高效率，而不仅仅是为了追求最高速度。,"I'm really glad to see someone finally use aerodynamics for efficiency, and not just top speed"
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Suggestion,8,作为一名工程师，我认为这辆车在空气动力学方面非常漂亮，但是其进入功能需要审视一下。如果它的进入控制系统是为了空气动力学而做了过度设计，我百分之百会买一辆这样的车。,"As an engineer myself, this is beautiful aerodynamics wise but the access features need an overview. I would 100% buy a car like this if the access controls were over engineered for aerodynamics"
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,16,是的，我下了两个订单。一个是首发版（400英里续航），另一个是未来的600英里续航版。1000英里续航的版本就没必要了。这辆车非常适合用来处理大多数杂事。对于已经退休的我来说，它简直是万能的！我们镇上有很多电动高尔夫球车……我真希望看到Aptera能取代它们，让这种全天候、更安全的车行驶在公路上，而不是在那些混乱的高尔夫球车道上……,"YES, two reservation. One for the LAUNCH  Edition ( 400 mi range ) and one for the future 600 mi range. No need for the 1000 mi range.perfect vehicle for most errands. Being retired, perfect for everything ! We have so many electric golf cats in this town… I’d love to see Aptera replace them, placing this all weather, safer vehicle in the road and not in the confusing golf car lanes…"
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,1925,“用订阅来告诉我”这个说法有点狂野啊，笑死,“Let me know by subscribing” is kind of wild lmao
The Solar Powered Aptera EV 👀,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZMMySvsKAA,Positive Feedback,2,我也是一名预订车主和Accelerator成员！绝对会买。效率是我的强迫症——这就是我当初迷上电动汽车的原因。它能满足我99%的出行需求。每年剩下的一两天，我可能会租另一辆电动车。说真的，这太需要实现了，我很高兴看到它被报道。,"Also a reservation holder and Accelerator here! Absolutely would buy. Efficiency is my OCD - that's why I'm into EVs to begin with. It'd take me 99% of the places I want to go and do. The other day or two a year, I might rent another EV. Seriously, this needs to happen and I'm so excited to see it covered."
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Question,15047,我不明白小米的第三个摄像头怎么能做得那么小，效果却还那么好。,l don't understand how the Xiaomi's 3rd camera can be so small yet so good
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,7859,它还比iPhone轻，简直太疯狂了。,"It's also LIGHTER than the iphone, which is just crazy."
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,2271,这就是手机版的“我是你，但比你更好”,"This is the phone version of 
"" I am you but better"""
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,129,刚看完这个视频就紧接着看到一个iPhone广告，真是太讽刺了。,Getting an iPhone ad immediately after this video is peak irony
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Negative Sentiment,6589,苹果CEO意识到外包也许不是个好主意。,Apple CEO realising outsourcing maybe wasn’t a great idea
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,6349,这就像那个抄袭你的人，结果却取得了最好的成绩😂😂,This is like that guy who cheats from you yet he gets the best grades 😂😂
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,1965,“你用什么手机”..... 哦，一个17 Pro Max... “呃... 哪一款？”,"""What phone do you use"".....
Oh, a 17 Pro Max...
""Uhhh which one?"""
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,498,这种命名匹配的方式真是个天才之举，它不仅是一种营销策略，而且当人们搜索 17 pro 或 pro max 时，他们也会看到这个产品，并可能因此改变购买决策。,"The name matching is actually genius, not only it’s a marketing stunt also when people search 17 pro or pro max they will see this and they may change the purchasing decision"
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Negative Sentiment,4166,当一个近乎1:1的抄袭者，在几乎所有方面都让原作看起来像个廉价复制品时，你就知道原作有多糟糕了。,You know it's bad when the nearly 1:1 copycat makes the original look like the cheap copy in nearly every way possible
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Negative Sentiment,213,真有趣，所有這些科技創作者都在吹捧小米，但他們自己根本沒人會用。,Gotta love how all this tech creators are praising the Xiaomi but none will actually use it
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,1025,作为一名摄影师，我一看到“Leica Vario-Summilux”这个词就心动了。,"As a photographer as soon as I saw ""Leica Vario-Summilux"" Im sold"
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Suggestion,61,马奎斯，你也应该评测一下小米17手机的稳定性问题。,"Marques, you should also evaluate the stability issues of xiaomi 17 phones."
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,1847,那个背屏看起来很有用，哪怕只是用来拍自拍。,That back screen looks useful to have if only just for selfies
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,397,致所有好奇的人：小米在9月/10月在中国发布其产品，然后在2026年初（通常是2月或3月）发布可在任何地方使用的全球版本。,"For anyone wondering xiaomi releases their products in china in September/october, then globally (global versions) which can be used anywhere in early 2026 (usually February or March)"
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,1576,小米在各方面看起来都好得多。如果他们能出一个我们可以在美国真正用作日常主力机的版本，我肯定会买。,The Xiaomi looks far better in every way.  If they ever make a  version we can actually use as a daily driver in the US. I am game.
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,2,小米CEO肯定跟苹果有什么私人恩怨，哈哈,Xiaomi ceo must be having some personal issues with apple lol
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Suggestion,747,"在我们不断追求更亮屏幕的同时，我希望他们也能推动更低的亮度，尤其是在晚上，即使会损失画质也无所谓。最低设置在晚上常常还是太亮了，我不得不同时使用‘降低白点值’功能和夜览模式。

编辑：我上面说了我用‘降低白点值’😂，但我刚把它调到了80%。我想说的是，把它（这个功能）整合进去！RWP（降低白点值）和亮度控制可以更好地结合，尤其是在iPhone上。","As we keep pushing for brighter screens, I’d appreciate if they pushed for lower brightness too esp at night regardless of quality loss. Lowest setting often still too bright at night and I have to use the reduce white point feature + night shift

Edit: I said above I use reduce white point😂 but I just turned it up to 80%. All I’m saying is, INTEGRATE IT INTO IT!  RWP and brightness control could be integrated better esp with iPhones."
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,465,这感觉像是苹果和小米的联动，即使苹果自己都不知道 😅,This feels like a crossover between apple and xiaomi even if apple had no idea 😅
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Positive Feedback,184,这命名格式也太好笑了😂,Matching the naming scheme is hilarious 😂
This or the iPhone?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIFkrVU5Krk,Other,2,重要的不仅仅是规格参数，芯片上元器件的布局方式同样重要。例如，它会影响到能效和整体使用寿命。因此，一部电池容量更大的手机，其电量消耗速度反而可能更快，这是完全有可能的。,"It’s not just about the specs but how the components are laid out on the chip also matters. For instance, it can impact the efficiency and overall lifespan. So it's quite possible that a phone with a larger battery size could drain faster."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Other,30009,公平地说，苹果刚刚推出了两个新的表情符号。,"In all fairness, Apple just introduced two new emojis."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Negative Sentiment,35854,很多人会讨论和支持，但没人会买的手机。,Type of phone many people will talk about and support but no one’s gonna buy.
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Other,8529,Marques 没有提到这一点，但 512GB Pro Max 版本的价格也只要 840 美元，而 iPhone 则要 1300 美元。,"Marques didn't mention it but is also just $840 for the 512gb pro max version, vs the iphone $1300"
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,228,对于那些说这款手机只是说说没人买的人，它实际上在中国已经卖断货了。我刚在淘宝上搜了一下，Pro Max版本至少要等一个星期。说句公道话，我那位作为苹果粉丝的朋友，也是第一次真正考虑是买iPhone 17还是小米17 Pro Max😂。,"To these people who said this phone is people talk but no one buy, it’s actually sold out in China. I just search it on Taobao,the pro max version has to wait at least one week. To be fair, this is the first time my friend as a apple’s fan actually consider weather to buy iPhone 17 or xiaomi 17 promax😂"

Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,4446,他们能在同样的外形尺寸下，塞进所有这些顶级规格的功能、大容量电池、背部副屏、指纹识别器等等，并且还把机身做得更轻，这太疯狂了。这几乎让苹果看起来像是不够努力。,"It's crazy how they manage to put all those features with maxed out specs, with a huge battery, an extra display on the back, the fingerprint reader, etc. in the same form factor and still make it ligther. It almost makes it look like apple is not trying hard enough."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,2115,我认为他们在背面放一个时间显示的主要原因，是因为在许多商业文化中，当你在开会或商务用餐时，如果你不想错过任何通知或电话，把手机屏幕朝下放在桌上会更有礼貌。因此，这其实是一个相当不错的设计。,"I think the main reason why they put a time display on the back is becuase in many business culture, if you don't want to miss any notifications or calls during a meeting or business meal, it'll be more polite to have your phone on the table screen side down so it is actually kinda neat of a design"
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,6,当他说那段视频是用手机录制的时候，我不得不倒回去看才发现区别，这实在太令人印象深刻了。如果他不说，我根本就看不出来。虽然有可见的差异，但只有在知道并进行并排对比时才能发现。那套相机设备太牛了！,"the fact that i had to revert back the video to see the difference when he said that's a video being recorded on the phone is mad impressive. if he never mentioned i couldn't have figured it out. 

It's visible difference but only if one knows and checks them side by side. 

That camera setup is wild!"

Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,2189,我喜欢这个复古游戏外壳，它让副屏变得非常讨人喜欢。,"I like the retro gaming case, makes the secondary screen very likable."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Negative Sentiment,3268,我不知道所有评测者怎么都“忽略”了这一点，但小米并没有抄袭相机凸台的设计，他们多年前就有了。,"I don't know how every reviewer seems to ""miss"" this, but Xiaomi didn't copy the canera plateau, they literally had that for years"
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,1,如果你是iPhone爱好者，你就会明白他电脑上的时间是一个明确的致敬。Marques Brownlee，干得好。,"If you’re an iPhone enthusiast, you will understand that the hour in his computer is clear reference. Great job Marques Brownlee."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,7481,还是对小米更进一步加上那块屏幕的做法感到惊叹。,Still can’t get over how Xiaomi just went one step further with adding the screen
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Negative Sentiment,1745,11:38 与我们现有的东西相比，它的表现有点令人尴尬。,11:38 It’s kind of embarrassing what it does next to the stuff we have available
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,62,5分50秒的镜头太惊人了🤯🤯,5:50 the camera🤯🤯

Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,350,其实，小米早在2020年的小米11 Ultra上就提出了这个设计。他们只是把背面的屏幕做得更大了。但2020年的那款11 Ultra在当时遥遥领先于任何手机，并且至今仍然可以和今天的大多数手机相媲美。,"Actually, Xiaomi already came up with this design in 2020 with the Xiaomi 11 ultra. They just made the back screen even bigger. But that 11 ultra in 2020 was just way ahead of any phone back then and can still hang with most phones today"
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,2068,这款手机太超前了，我刚下单，昨天就到了。,"This phone is so far ahead of its time, I just ordered it and it arrived yesterday."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Positive Feedback,314,我也非常喜歡他們與徠卡的相機合作。它的色彩處理方式（除了我很少拍的團體人像照，為此我會安裝GCam以備不時之需）正合我意，也通常是我試圖將照片後製成的色調風格。它傾向於戲劇性/氛圍感，而不是蘋果、谷歌和幾乎所有其他主流品牌所追求的增強現實感和重度HDR風格，這讓你的照片在社群媒體上能從你認識的大多數人中脫穎而出。,"I also just love the Leica camera collab they have. The coloring approach (for anything other than group photos of human subjects which I don't do much and just install GCam for, in case) is just really right up my alley and is typically the kind of coloring that I try to edit my photos towards. It leans towards dramatic/atmospheric instead of the elevated-realism + HDR-heavy approach that Apple, Google, and almost every other major brand tries to go for, and it sets your photos apart from most people you know in social media."
Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,Negative Sentiment,20,它要卖870美元😂😂😂 他们的市值都超过iPhone了,"It is $870😂😂😂
They've got a market cap over the iPhone"
